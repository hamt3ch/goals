# Goals
Personal repo to keep track of my goals.


## Introduction
This repo will contain all my goals for the years to come and will leverage Github's functionality to check things off as I completely them through the year. 

Every year I will create a markdown with a checklist of things I need to completely by EOY. Each check will have a detailed explanation of how to accomplish/mark the goal as complete. All changes to the doc must go through review process (pull request) and be validated by someone other than the creator.
